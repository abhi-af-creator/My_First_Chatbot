# My_First_Chatbot
AI-Powered PDF Chatbot is an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload PDFs and ask questions about their content. It uses LangChain, FAISS, and HuggingFace models to extract, retrieve, and generate accurate, context-aware answers through a simple Streamlit interface

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload and read multiple PDF files  
- 🔍 Uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate answers  
- 🧩 Uses **FAISS** for fast similarity search  
- 🤖 Leverages **Flan-T5** (HuggingFace model) for high-quality responses  
- 💬 Built with **Streamlit** for a clean, interactive UI  
- ⚙️ Optimized for performance and modular design
